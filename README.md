# HunchosWebsite

Hello, this is my personal website/project. It will serve as a sort of blog that I can journal in and express myself creatively while praciticing and establishing my skills with HTML and CSS. As of 01/17/2022, I have been studying HTML for about a week and have made significant progress to help me create my own websites. Overtime, I hope to continue adding to this project. FOr now, enjoy the process of this website's construction.
